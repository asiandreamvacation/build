							<h3 id="thailand">THAILAND</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>




							<p>Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam, is a country at
								the centre of the Indochinese peninsula in Southeast Asia. With a total area of
								approximately 513,000 km2 (198,000 sq mi), Thailand is the world's 50th-largest country.
								It is the 20th-most-populous country in the world, with around 69 million people.
								Thailand is a constitutional monarchy and has switched between parliamentary democracy
								and military junta for decades, the latest coup being in May 2014 by the National
								Council for Peace and Order. Its capital and most populous city is Bangkok. It is
								bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the
								south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the
								southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of
								Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest.
							</p>





							<h4> AYUTHAYA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/ayuthaya.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The sacred city, the sacked city, Ayuthaya is complexly intertwined with Thai
								nationalism and religion. Ayuthaya was the former royal capital. The city was named
								after Ayodhya (Sanskrit for 'unassailable' or 'undefeatable'), the home of Rama in the
								Indian epic Ramayana. Its full Thai name is Phra Nakhon Si Ayuthaya (Sacred City of
								Ayuthaya). A day trip gives a superb introduction to the architectural heritage of the
								ancient capital Ayutthaya. A thriving trade and political capital of Siam for over 400
								years, Ayutthaya is filled with palaces, temples and religious monuments of great
								historical and cultural significance - even in their ruined state. It is fair to say
								that no study of Thai architecture or art is complete without a trip to this once
								glorious capital, which gave birth to the unique U-Thong style.
							</p>

							<h4> BANGKOK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/bangkok.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand. Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist
								destination cities. With so much of life conducted on the street, there are few cities
								in the world that reward exploration as handsomely as Bangkok. Cap off an extended boat
								trip with a visit to a hid- den market. A stroll off Banglamphu's beaten track can end
								in conversation with a monk. Get lost in the tiny lanes of Chinatown and come face to
								face with a live Chinese opera performance. After dark, let the BTS (Sky- train) escort
								you to Th Sukhumvit, where the local nightlife scene reveals a sophisticated and dynamic
								city. Among Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples,
								including Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun, to name a few. The Giant Swing andErawan
								Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. Vimanmek Mansion in
								Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the Jim Thompson
								House provides an example of traditional Thai architecture. Other major museums include
								the Bangkok National Museum and the Royal Barges National Museum. Cruises and boat trips
								on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional
								architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.

							</p>







							<h4> CHIANG MAI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/chiang-mai.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Including: Loi Krathong (known locally as Yi Peng): Held on the full moon of the 12th
								month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar, being the full moon of the 2nd month of
								the old Lanna calendar. In the western calendar this usually falls in November. Every
								year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers decorated with flowers
								and candles onto the waterways of the city to worship the Goddess of Water.
								Lanna-stylesky lanterns, which are hot-air balloons made of paper, are launched into the
								air. The sky lanterns are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also taken
								to decorate houses and streets. Songkran : Held in mid-April to celebrate the
								traditional Thai new year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to
								visit for this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the
								good-natured city-wide water-fight) take place each year, along with parades and a Miss
								Songkran beauty competition. Chiang Mai Flower Festival : A three-day festival held
								during the first weekend in February each year, this event occurs when Chiang Mai's
								temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom. Tam Bun Khan Dok, the Inthakin (City
								Pillar) Festival, starts on the day of the waning moon of the six lunar month and lasts
								6-8 days
							</p>

							<h4> PATTAYA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/pattaya.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Pattaya's a stay up late kind of town, but wake up earlier than most and there are
								activities galore to redress your daytime/nighttime balance. Hit the dive shops to
								explore the city's offshore reefs and wrecks, or get some fresh air on world-class golf
								courses. And if you're here with the family, the kids will find plenty to do to make it
								a real holiday.
							</p>

							<h4> PHUKET</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/phuket.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Phuket is Thailand's largest and most popular island, Phuket is as colourful as it is
								cosmopolitan and one of the world's most famous dream destinations. Phuket boasts some
								lush inland vistas, including a few remote swathes of rainforest on Ko Yao, but the
								island really comes into its own along its western shoreline, where hunter-green foliage
								meets the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea. The mile upon sandy mile of coastline
								boasts tons of water sports, delectable restaurants and decadent resorts
							</p>

							<h4> PHI PHI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/phi-phi.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The Phi Phi Islands are located in Thailand, between the large island of Phuket and the
								western Andaman Sea coast of the mainland. The islands feature beaches and clear water
								that have had their natural beauty protected by National Park status. In the early 1990s
								only the most adventurous travelers visited the island, staying in only the most basic
								accommodation. Nowadays, however, the place has turned into one of the major
								destinations for visitors to Krabi. Ko Phi Phi is a popular place for diving and
								snorkeling, kayaking and other marine recreational activities.</p>


							<h4> KANCHANABURI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/kanchanaburi.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Kanchanaburi is a town in the west of Thailand and the capital of Kanchanaburi province.
								With field, forest and stream, Kanchanaburi has become a catch basin for new arrivals
								overwhelmed by Bangkok (a mere 130km east) and a closer alternative than Chiang Mai for
								Thailand's soft version of 'trekking' (elephant rides, short hikes and bamboo rafting).
								The town sits in a fertile valley where sugar-cane fields bow in the breeze, measuring
								out an easy pace. Kanchanaburi is famous for their temple caves, an underground
								communion of animistic spirit worship and traditional Buddhism.</p>


							<h4> KHAO LAK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/khao-lak.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								As the most practical base for exploring the Similan and Surin islands as well as the
								mainland wonders of Khao Sok and Khao Lak/Lam Ru National Parks, it's no wonder that the
								beautiful, bronze beach of Khao Lak has been experiencing a tourist gold rush in recent
								years. After the area's near total devastation from the Boxing Day tsunami and
								subsequent rebuilding, resorts have been flinging open their doors, tourists (especially
								divers) have been flooding in and new infrastructure has been laid down at a terrific
								rate

							</p>

							<h4> KO PHA NGAN</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/ko-pha-ngan.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Ko Pha Ngan (or Koh Phangan, is an island in the Gulf of Thailand in South East
								Thailand, and located in Surat Thani Province. It is famous for its full moon party at
								Haad Rin Beach and as a backpackers destination. Ko Pha Ngan has two sister islands: the
								larger Ko Samui to the south and the smaller Ko Tao to the north.
							</p>



							<h4> KO SAMUI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/ko-samui.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>


							<p>
								Ko Samui , often called just Samui is an island in the Gulf of Thailand. Ko Samui is a
								fairly big island. The most popular and commercialised beaches are Chaweng and Lamai,
								while the northern beaches and their adjacent villages of Mae Nam, Bophut, Bang Rak and
								Choeng Mon are more peaceful choices, and the west coast beaches are still comparatively
								quiet. Ko Samui is paradise - white-sand beaches with palms blowing in the wind and
								clear green seas sparkling in the sunlight, against a picture-perfect background of lush
								green hills and brown roads interspersed with rough wooden structures
								Hua Hin
								Krabi
