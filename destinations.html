							<h3 id="singapore">1) SINGAPORE</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>Singapore is a city-state in Southeast Asia. Founded as a British trading colony in 1819,
								since independence it has become one of the world's most prosperous countries and boasts
								the world's busiest port. Combining the skyscrapers and subways of a modern, affluent
								city with a medley of Chinese, Malay and Indian influences and a tropical climate, with
								tasty food, good shopping and a vibrant night-life scene, this Garden City makes a great
								stopover or springboard into the region. Some of the main attractions for tourists in
								Singapore are city centre with magnificent lighted buildings, temples, gambling in two
								great casinos, food, entertainment parks and annual festivals. Singapore is also a
								medical tourism centre of Southeastern Asia.
								Singapore is in fact one of the most enjoyable cities in Southeast Asia. As you zoom in
								from one of the world's best airports along the lushly tree-shaded expressway. And as
								you stroll through the fashion emporiums of Orchard Rd, poke around antique shops in
								Chinatown or take a walk around one of the dozens of beautiful city parks, you'll know
								the city bears no comparison to crime- and poverty of neighboring countries. You can be
								drinking and dancing until dawn in the city's pubs and clubs, or sipping a cocktail
								surrounded by the colonial elegance of a Raffles Hotel veranda.
								There's no law that says an Asian city can't be well run. It may have been a long and
								difficult haul from swampy colonial outpost and notorious den of vice to powerhouse
								industrial nation, but those who say that Singapore has lost its soul along the way
								couldn't be more wrong.

								Few cities in Southeast Asia can boast Singapore's fascinating ethnic brew. Where else
								in the world can you dip into the cultures of China, India and Muslim Malaysia all in
								one day, against a backdrop of ultra-modern Western commerce? Not only has Singapore's
								history of migration left a rich cultural and architectural legacy that makes wandering
								the streets an absorbing delight, it has created one of the world's great eating
								capitals. If there's one thing more stylish than the bars and restaurants, it's the
								boutiques that have made Singapore a byword in Asia for extravagant shopping. Away from
								the Gucci and Louis Vuitton onslaught of Orchard Rd, however, there are bargains to be
								found on everything from clothes to electronics - and a range of art and antique shops
								that few Asian cities can match.

								But Singapore is not all about shopping and eating. Nor is the notion of Singapore as
								completely urbanized anything more than popular myth. Adventure activities include
								diving with sharks at Underwater World on Sentosa, mountain biking around Bukit Timah,
								leopard-spotting at Singapore Zoo's magical Night Safari, waterskiing or wakeboarding on
								the Kallang River, go-karting and rock climbing. And if you want to retreat from
								civilization completely, the centre of the island retains large tracts of forest where
								the only sound you can hear is the monkeys swinging through the trees. In fact,
								Singapore is one of only two cities in the world that still retains a patch of primary
								rainforest, in the form of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

								It's a fascinating place - and a remarkable achievement. No-one is denying that
								Singaporeans have had to sacrifice some level of freedom in their island's rise from
								racially divided, resource-starved port town. But you get the feeling that if Western
								development aid had ever matched Singapore's strides in poverty reduction, education,
								infrastructure and health care, they'd be patting themselves on the back and saying that
								political freedom was a small sacrifice to make.
								Besides, it's not all strait-laced conformity. You don't have to look far to find echoes
								of the island's colourful, rakish past, or evidence of a thriving and creatively
								unfettered artistic community. Singapore's soul is alive and well - and it is unique.
							</p>

							<h4>JURONG BIRD PARK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/jurong-bird-park.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								This ageing attraction is still popular with school kids, families and nature
								photographers. The Jurong Bird Park is home to 8000 birds -600 species, 30 of them
								endangered. Visitors walk through themed enclosures along 1.7km worth of trails:
								pelicans gawp at passers-by along a boardwalk, leggy pink flamingos stand proud by a
								lake, penguins nosedive through
								water in air-conditioned comfort and cutting through it all is the escapable scent of
								bird poop.


							</p>


							<h4>ORCHARD ROAD</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/orchard-road.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								Famous by name, Orchard Rd was once was lined with nutmeg and pepper plantations.
								Today it's the domain of Singapore's elite and well-heeled tourists, lured here by
								the shopping centres, nightspots, restaurants, bars and lounges. A showcase for the
								material delights of capitalism, Orchard Rd also possesses
								some sights of cultural interest where a credit card is not required.


							</p>


							<h4>LITTLE INDIA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/little-india.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								This modest but colourful area of wall-to-wall shops, pungent aromas and Hindi film
								music
								is a relief from the prim modernity of many parts of the city. Centred around the
								southern
								end of Serangoon Rd, this is the place to come to pick up that framed print of Krishna
								you've always wanted, eat great food and watch streetside cooks fry chapatis. The
								Zhujiao Centre is the main market, but there are also interesting spice shops nearby.
								The best temples are Sri Veeramakaliamman, Sri Srinivasa Perumal and the glitzy Temple
								of 1000 Lights.


							</p>

							<h4>BUTTERFLY PARK & INSECT KINGDOM</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/buttery-fly-park.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>
								You'll be fluttered by more than 50 species of butterfly inside the Butterfly Park &
								Insect Kingdom.
								The Insect Kingdom museum has thousands of mounted butterflies, rhino beetles, Hercules
								beetles
								(the world's largest), scorpions, and other critters and varmints - kids stare wide-eyed
								while adults feign disinterest.

							</p>

							<h4>SINGAPORE ZOO</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/singapore-zoo.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>
								Set on a peninsula jutting into the Upper Seletar Reservoir, the Singapore Zoo is
								world class. Its 28 landscaped hectares and open concept (no cages) are a far cry
								from the sad concrete confines some zoos retain. The Singapore Zoo is one of the best in
								the world.

							</p>

							<h4>SINGAPORE FLYER</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/singapore-flyer.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								The Singapore Flyer is an expensive 30-minute ride with views towards the Colonial
								District, CBD, Marina Bay, the high-rise housing landscape to the east and out to the
								South China Sea. You're better off going on a clear day than at night, if only to avoid
								the annoying flashing neon lights outside the cabin


							</p>

							<h4>SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/singapore-botanical-garden.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								If Singapore's urban planners could manufacture paradise, it wouldn't look too
								different from the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The front entrance leads to an idyllic koi
								pond.
								On weekends, laughing children feed the multicoloured fish. Right behind, a waterfall
								gurgles and birds hop around the water's edge, at ease with the locals

							</p>

							<h4>NIGHT SAFARI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/night-safari.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								You can walk around the three trails in the 40-hectare forested park but the best
								experience is via the tram (adult/child S$10/5), even though we think it's a little
								cheeky (and greedy) that you have to pay for the atmospheric
								45-minute jungle tour past a parade of 120 different spot-lit nocturnal species.


							</p>

							<h4>WINGS OF TIME </h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/wings-of-time.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								End your day at Sentosa with the Award Winning Outdoor Night Show (Wings of Time) in the
								world set against the majestic open sea. Be mesmerized by a multi-sensory presentation
								of water display, laser show, fire effects and
								spectacular music as you soar through space and time in a magical adventure.


							</p>

							<h4> UNIVERSAL STUDIOS </h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/universal-studios.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>
								Universal Studios Singapore is a theme park located within Resorts World Sentosa
								onSentosa Island, Singapore. It was a key component of Genting's bid for the right to
								build Singapore's second integrated resort. It is the second Universal Studios theme
								park to open in Asia (Japan being the first), and the first in Southeast Asia. Universal
								Parks & Resorts markets the park as a "one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia" and promises
								that
								the park will be the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia for the next 30 years


							</p>











							<h3 id="dubai"> 2) DUBAI</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>




							<p>Dubai is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is
								located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of
								Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the
								only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the
								country's Federal Supreme Council. The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's
								northern coastline and heads the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai will host
								World Expo 2020. Dubai emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It
								is also a major transport hub forpassengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was
								based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but
								oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969. Dubai's
								oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are
								limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue
								comes from oil.
							</p>





							<h4> BURJ KHALIFA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/burj-khalifa.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Ever been on top of the world? Experience a spellbinding view of Dubai from world’s
								tallest architectural edifice with over 160+ stories – Burj Khalifa, which has already
								outdone most of the World Records like tallest building, tallest free-standing
								structure, and highest observation deck etc. This man-made marvel hosting an ensemble of
								leisure spaces such as sky-high restaurants, a colossal aquarium, Dubai Mall among many
								others.
							</p>

							<h4> FERRARI WORLD</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/ferrai-world.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Yet another record breaking marvel in the Arabian Gulf is the world’s largest indoor
								theme park, Ferrari World. Located on the Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World
								surprises its refugees with several action-packed rides and boasts to have the fastest
								roller coaster in the world, Formula Rossa. Along with many other rides and experiences,
								one could get to know Ferrari’s inspiring race to what it has become now.

							</p>

							<h4> DESERT SAFARI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/desert-safari.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The best and the most feasible of all the adventures one can seek in the undulating
								desert-scape of Arabia is the Desert Safari. Dive deep and rise higher with the
								sun-gilded dunes in a 4×4 drive, enjoy the photogenic face of the Arabian Desert against
								the entrancing sunset view. Walk over the sand or take a camel ride, let the falcon
								perch on your shoulder or the Henna designs adorn your hands, or savor the sumptuous
								dinner in the desert.
							</p>

							<h4> DHOW CRUISE</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/dhow-cruise.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Parting Dubai in two – Bur to the south and Deira to the north, Dubai Creek once was the
								centre of economic significance with all the trade and transactions taking place on its
								brink. Dubai’s pearling industry, which fashioned the main sector of the city’s economy,
								was based primarily on expeditions in this saltwater creek. Granting, the city has
								crawled towards its south-end along the coast, the creek is still bustling with dhows
								and abras laden with goods and people.
							</p>

							<h4> ATLANTIS LOST CHAMBER</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/atlantis-lost-chamber.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Get closer than you ever have been to over 65,000 marine animals and unearth the
								mysteries of the Atlantean civilization at Atlantis Lost Chamber. Believed to be a
								remnant of the lost city of Atlantis buried under the Persian Gulf for over thousand
								years, surfaced during the construction of the resort. This labyrinthine underwater trip
								would not refrain from surprising you at any point.
							</p>

							<h4> ATLANTIS AQUAVENTURE</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/atlantic-aquaventure.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Give your adrenaline a rush through your veins. Try sea kayaking or windsurfing. If that
								is not enough, push the notch up a bit and slide through the see-through acrylic tube
								raided by sharks all around it. Or even better would be a shark safari while snorkeling
								in their water. All these is now not a dream when you are in Atlantis Aquaventure.</p>


							<h4> ICELAND WATER PARK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/iceland-water-park.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Located in Ras Al Khaimah, Iceland Water Park is yet another such package with amusing
								attractions like Penguin Falls – the largest man-made waterfalls in the world, Wave Pool
								– the largest of its kind in the region and Coral Reef, for an incredible snorkeling
								experience in a natural setting. Just a 45 minutes drive from Dubai, the major draw of
								this leisure spot is its distinctive locale amidst captivating Hajar Mountains and the
								Arabian Gulf. This trip is surely an intriguing day-out for family and friends..</p>


							<h4> SKI DUBAI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/dubai/ski-dubai.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Cuddle a penguin, sledge down the icy mountains. Sounds crazy? Well, a trip to Ski Dubai
								will make you believe our saner minds prevail. Ranging over about 22,500 sq feet, Ski
								Dubai facility lets you indulge in winter sports in a snow-clad mountainous setting. Be
								it ice skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing or just simply mounting snow into a snowman.
								Let nothing avert your adventure spirit from snowballing this time.
							</p>









							<h3 id="malaysia"> 3) MALAYSIA</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>




							<p>Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia. It consists of
								thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of 330,803 square
								kilometres (127,720 sq mi) separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized
								regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia
								shares a land and maritime border with Thailand at the north and maritime borders with
								Singapore at the south, Vietnam at the northeast, and Indonesia in the west. East
								Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime
								border with the Philippines and Vietnam. The capital city is Kuala Lumpur, while
								Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. With a population of over 30 million,
								Malaysia is the 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental
								Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17
								megadiverse countries on earth, with large numbers of endemic species.</p>





							<h4> KUALA LUMPUR</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/kaula-lumpur.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Kuala Lumpur, the sixth most visited city in the world, is the capital of Malaysia.
								Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs and wide
								gastronomic and shopping variety. The major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include
								the Merdeka Square, the House of Parliament, the Petaling Street, the National Palace
								(Istana Negara), the Kuala Lumpur Tower, the National Museum, the Central Market, the
								Monument, andreligious sites such as the Jamek Mosque and Batu Caves.The entertainment
								hub of the city is mainly centered in the Golden Triangle encompassing Jalan P. Ramlee,
								Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. </p>

							<h4> GENTLING ISLANDS</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/gentling-island.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Known as the "Fun City Above the Cloud", Genting Highlands is the only legal land-based
								casino, Casino de Genting, in the country and is owned by Genting Malaysia Berhad, a
								subsidiary of Genting Group. The resort has three theme parks which are Genting Outdoor
								Theme Park, First World Indoor Theme Park and Water Park. It is accessible by car from
								Kuala Lumpur in one hour, or also accessible by a cable car called Genting Skyway (3.38
								km) which at its opening used to be the world's fastest and South East Asia's longest
								gondola lift.
							</p>

							<h4> PUTRA JAYA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/putra-jaya.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Putrajaya is a planned city, located 25km south of Kuala Lumpur, that serves as the
								federal administrative centre of Malaysia. The seat of government was shifted in 1999
								from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya, due to the overcrowding and congestion in the Kuala
								Lumpur areas. In Malay/Sanskrit, the words "putra" or "putera" means "prince", and
								"jaya" means "success" or "victory". The botanical gardens, the Seri Wawasan bridge and
								a cruise by evening in the city is a must do when you visit the city. </p>

							<h4> LANGKAWI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/langkawi.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Officially known as Langkawi, the Jewel of Kedah is an archipelago of 104 islands in
								theAndaman Sea, some 30 km off the mainland coast of northwestern Malaysia. Malaysia's
								best-known holiday destination, Langkawi is one of those places whose name alone summons
								up images of tropical romance and carefree days under swaying coconut palms. Fringed
								with long, sandy beaches and with an interior of jungle-clad hills and picturesque
								paddy-fields, it's easy to see why this is Malaysia's most heavily promoted tourist
								hotspot. Away from the built-up areas Langkawi is still a rural Malay island of small
								villages, rice paddies, water buffaloes and natural beauty.</p>

							<h4> PENANG</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/penang.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Like many company settlements, Penang wilted after the collapse of the British Empire.
								Today it's become the 'Silicon Valley' of Malaysia although this high-tech world is
								scarcely noticeable to the casual traveler. Beyond the capital Georgetown's heat and
								decay are beach resorts, such as Batu Ferringhi, and the sleepy Malay fishing village of
								Teluk Bahang. Entrepreneurs of every imaginable ethnicity, most notably Chinese, flocked
								to this new land, creating wealth and cultural hybrids. Penang showcases a religious
								fusion of Temples, as well as churches and Mosques.</p>

							<h4> TIOMAN ISLAND</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/tioman-island.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Like a giant sleeping dragon, the dark green ridges of Tioman Island rise up above the
								waters of the South China Sea. On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the dragon's
								dark green scales are in fact giant trees and impenetrable jungle; that the grey claws
								are giant granite boulders and that the dragon's horns are twin peaks with smooth,
								straight cliffs, surrounded with swirls of mist. The natural beauty of the island is its
								biggest attraction. Lush tropical jungle covers about 12,000 hectares of the island and
								countless mountain streams and waterfalls sustain the many protected species of mammals
								and birds. Tioman has options for every kind of holiday-maker: families with small
								children, honeymooners, scuba divers, backpackers, adventurers and even those looking
								for a slice of exclusivity and luxury.</p>


							<h4> TAMAN NEGARA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/taman-negara.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								No holiday or vacation in the tropics is complete without visiting a tropical
								rainforest. And there's no grandeur than to visit the TAMAN NEGARA, reputed to be The
								Oldest Jungle, The Best Kept Tropical Rainforest & The Great Natural Wonders of the
								world. By that it means that Taman Negara's flora & fauna has evolved naturally over
								hundreds of millions of years without any disruption or major calamities. The stated
								purpose of Taman Negara is "to utilise the land within the park in perpetuity, for the
								propagation, protection and preservation of indigeneous flora and fauna". With so much
								to see and do, a trip to Taman Negara is a must on your itinerary.</p>


							<h4> SELANGOR</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/selangor.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Located on the west coast of Peninsula Malaysia, the state of Selangor occupies some
								125,000 sq. km. Outside its cities, Selangor is adorned with lush green vegetation that
								varies with the landscape and topography - from the coastal mangroves and verdant
								tropical rainforest right down to the charming fishing villages that dot the coastline.
								The great Titiwangsa Range runs across Selangor. Should you be inclined to trek up the
								many hills and mountains here, you'll discover that they each feature a unique
								personality that is simply thrilling.</p>




							<h4> MELAKA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/malaysia/melaka.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								One of Malaysia's most eagerly sought-after destinations, the small city-state of Melaka
								(Malacca) lures droves of visitors to its namesake historic port city, where they are

							<p>
								Malaysia's most extensive hill station, about 60km off the main KL-Ipoh-Butterworth road
								at Tapah, is at an altitude of 1300m to 1829m. The Cameron Highlands is a vast area of
								rolling green hills, tea plantations and forests. There's a network of jungle trails,
								waterfalls and mountains, and less-taxing points of interest, including colourful
								temples, rose gardens and tea plantations where visitors are welcome to try the local
								brew. Despite all the changes from an old fashioned English atmosphere, the regular
								rain, and the dampness and visiting hordes, the Cameron Highlands is still a relaxing
								destination and one of Malaysia's most rewarding stopovers.

							<h4> PANGKOR ISLANDS</h4>

								<img src="/malaysia/pangkor-island.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The island of Pangkor is low-key resort island noted for its fine beaches. The
								jungle-clad hills of the interior of this island, though, are virtually untouched. At 8
								sq km, Pangkor is a small island, but that hasn't stopped the state government from
								trying to promote it as one of Malaysia's main tourist destinations. Fishing and dried
								fish products are still a major industry for the island, particularly on the east coast,
								with most tourist development confined to the west coast. Pangkor is a popular local
								resort. It can get very crowded on weekends and holidays when prices are highest, but
								during the week the beaches are almost empty. </p>





							<h4> JOHOR BAHRU</h4>

							<p>
								Capital of the state of Johor, Johor Bahru (popularly called JB) is the southern gateway
								to Peninsular Malaysia, connected to Singapore by road and rail. Economically, it is one
								of the most important states in the country with various large plantations. They include
								commodities such as rubber, palm oil, and pineapple. On top of agricultural products,
								Johor is also becoming an industrial base. It has even developed to become one of the
								most populated states with Johor Bahru (JB), its capital city, as the second-largest
								city in Malaysia.

							<p>Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam, is a country at
								the centre of the Indochinese peninsula in Southeast Asia. With a total area of
								approximately 513,000 km2 (198,000 sq mi), Thailand is the world's 50th-largest country.
								It is the 20th-most-populous country in the world, with around 69 million people.
								Thailand is a constitutional monarchy and has switched between parliamentary democracy
								and military junta for decades, the latest coup being in May 2014 by the National
								Council for Peace and Order. Its capital and most populous city is Bangkok. It is
								bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the
								south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the
								southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of
								Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest.

							<h4> AYUTHAYA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/ayuthaya.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The sacred city, the sacked city, Ayuthaya is complexly intertwined with Thai
								nationalism and religion. Ayuthaya was the former royal capital. The city was named
								after Ayodhya (Sanskrit for 'unassailable' or 'undefeatable'), the home of Rama in the
								Indian epic Ramayana. Its full Thai name is Phra Nakhon Si Ayuthaya (Sacred City of
								Ayuthaya). A day trip gives a superb introduction to the architectural heritage of the
								ancient capital Ayutthaya. A thriving trade and political capital of Siam for over 400
								years, Ayutthaya is filled with palaces, temples and religious monuments of great
								historical and cultural significance - even in their ruined state. It is fair to say
								that no study of Thai architecture or art is complete without a trip to this once
								glorious capital, which gave birth to the unique U-Thong style.

							<h4> BANGKOK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/bangkok.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand. Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist
								destination cities. With so much of life conducted on the street, there are few cities
								in the world that reward exploration as handsomely as Bangkok. Cap off an extended boat
								trip with a visit to a hid- den market. A stroll off Banglamphu's beaten track can end
								in conversation with a monk. Get lost in the tiny lanes of Chinatown and come face to
								face with a live Chinese opera performance. After dark, let the BTS (Sky- train) escort
								you to Th Sukhumvit, where the local nightlife scene reveals a sophisticated and dynamic
								city. Among Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples,
								including Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun, to name a few. The Giant Swing andErawan
								Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. Vimanmek Mansion in
								Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the Jim Thompson
								House provides an example of traditional Thai architecture. Other major museums include
								the Bangkok National Museum and the Royal Barges National Museum. Cruises and boat trips
								on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional
								architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.

								month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar, being the full moon of the 2nd month of
								the old Lanna calendar. In the western calendar this usually falls in November. Every
								year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers decorated with flowers
								and candles onto the waterways of the city to worship the Goddess of Water.
								Lanna-stylesky lanterns, which are hot-air balloons made of paper, are launched into the
								air. The sky lanterns are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also taken
								to decorate houses and streets. Songkran : Held in mid-April to celebrate the
								traditional Thai new year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to
								visit for this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the
								good-natured city-wide water-fight) take place each year, along with parades and a Miss
								Songkran beauty competition. Chiang Mai Flower Festival : A three-day festival held
								during the first weekend in February each year, this event occurs when Chiang Mai's
								temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom. Tam Bun Khan Dok, the Inthakin (City

								Pattaya's a stay up late kind of town, but wake up earlier than most and there are
								activities galore to redress your daytime/nighttime balance. Hit the dive shops to
								explore the city's offshore reefs and wrecks, or get some fresh air on world-class golf
								courses. And if you're here with the family, the kids will find plenty to do to make it
								a real holiday.

							<p>
								Phuket is Thailand's largest and most popular island, Phuket is as colourful as it is
								cosmopolitan and one of the world's most famous dream destinations. Phuket boasts some
								lush inland vistas, including a few remote swathes of rainforest on Ko Yao, but the
								island really comes into its own along its western shoreline, where hunter-green foliage
								meets the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea. The mile upon sandy mile of coastline
								boasts tons of water sports, delectable restaurants and decadent resorts
							</p>

							<h4> PHI PHI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/phi-phi.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The Phi Phi Islands are located in Thailand, between the large island of Phuket and the
								western Andaman Sea coast of the mainland. The islands feature beaches and clear water
								that have had their natural beauty protected by National Park status. In the early 1990s
								only the most adventurous travelers visited the island, staying in only the most basic
								accommodation. Nowadays, however, the place has turned into one of the major
								destinations for visitors to Krabi. Ko Phi Phi is a popular place for diving and
								snorkeling, kayaking and other marine recreational activities.</p>


							<h4> KANCHANABURI</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/kanchanaburi.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Kanchanaburi is a town in the west of Thailand and the capital of Kanchanaburi province.
								With field, forest and stream, Kanchanaburi has become a catch basin for new arrivals
								overwhelmed by Bangkok (a mere 130km east) and a closer alternative than Chiang Mai for
								Thailand's soft version of 'trekking' (elephant rides, short hikes and bamboo rafting).
								The town sits in a fertile valley where sugar-cane fields bow in the breeze, measuring
								out an easy pace. Kanchanaburi is famous for their temple caves, an underground
								communion of animistic spirit worship and traditional Buddhism.</p>


							<h4> KHAO LAK</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/thailand/khao-lak.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								As the most practical base for exploring the Similan and Surin islands as well as the
								mainland wonders of Khao Sok and Khao Lak/Lam Ru National Parks, it's no wonder that the
								beautiful, bronze beach of Khao Lak has been experiencing a tourist gold rush in recent
								years. After the area's near total devastation from the Boxing Day tsunami and
								subsequent rebuilding, resorts have been flinging open their doors, tourists (especially
								divers) have been flooding in and new infrastructure has been laid down at a terrific
								rate

								while the northern beaches and their adjacent villages of Mae Nam, Bophut, Bang Rak and
								Choeng Mon are more peaceful choices, and the west coast beaches are still comparatively
								quiet. Ko Samui is paradise - white-sand beaches with palms blowing in the wind and
								clear green seas sparkling in the sunlight, against a picture-perfect background of lush
								green hills and brown roads interspersed with rough wooden structures

								<img src="/vietnam.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>




							<p>There’s more to Vietnam than the traditional image of rice paddies and conical hats. Here
								you’ll find a country bursting with energy and forward motion. You’ll feel it in the hum
								and activity on the streets. You’ll see it in the way Vietnamese welcome you to their
								homes, invite you to taste their food, and proudly show you their rich culture. You’ll
								sense it in the options and opportunities all around. Simply put, there's never been a
								more exciting time to visit.</p>





							<h4> HA LONG BAY</h4>

								green waters among thousands of rugged islands and islets, stopping at spectacular caves
								through which visitors can wander, viewing impressive, centuries-old formations. Hạ Long
								Bay's mystical beauty has made it a bucket list attraction within the country, but it's
								still possible to find secluded corners to call your own. </p>

							<h4> HUE</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/vietnam/hue.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								Huế is a city chock-full of stories. The Kings of the Nguyễn Dynasty built their feudal
								capital along Huế’s fertile riverbanks and atop its forested hills, but their imperial
								legacy is just one of many reasons to visit. Huế’s refined cuisine is the stuff of
								legend, and its leafy streets are lined with mossy pagodas, art déco mansions, and
								eye-popping markets. Through the whole scene flows the Perfume River, setting a languid
								pace the rest of the city is happy to follow.
							</p>

							<h4> MUI NE</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/vietnam/mui-ne.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								It's easy to lose track of time in Mũi Né, riding bicycles along the coast, spending
								afternoons by the pool, and dining on fresh seafood with the sound of the waves in the
								background. With ideal conditions for kitesurfing and windsurfing, brightly coloured
								kites are a fixture on Mũi Né's beaches year-round. Over the years, this seaside retreat
								has evolved to offer guesthouses and resorts of every stripe. Come for the surf, stay
								for the mellow atmosphere.</p>






							<h3> 6) CAMBODIA</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/cambodia.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>




							<p>Cambodia may be a small country, but it offers everything one needs for a wonderful
								vacation. Above the many reasons why most visitors return to visit time and again, are
								two that many would find difficult to match elsewhere. Firstly, Cambodia offers an
								incredible amount of history and culture and its nature is simply amazing to say the
								least; ranging from the gorgeous National Parks to the pristine beaches and relaxing
								islands, the flavours of Cambodia are not only in the exotic cuisines,
								but also its overall ambience.

								If you’re planning to visit Southeast Asia, Cambodia is certainly a ‘Must-visit’
								destination.</p>

							<p>
								Mondulkiri is about 543km north of Phnom Penh. Despite being the largest inland area;
								Mondulkiri is one of the most sparsely populated provinces in the country and can be
								reached by land or by air. Mondul Kiri is very rich in natural resources especially hard
								minerals such as gold and gems which can be found in all five districts of the province.
								Known also for its forested hills and beautiful waterfalls, Mondulkiri is one of the
								most popular destinations for Eco-tourism in Cambodia.

								More than 80 percent of the population in Mondul Kiri is made up of tribal minorities;
								the majority of them being from the Phnong tribe.

								Tourists are invited to participate in a wine-sipping tradition that dates back since
								the first visitors from the outside world visited the tribes many years ago. The wine is
								traditionally brewed from rice and stored in jars, some of which are more than a
								thousand years old.


								The remaining 20 percent are collectively made up of Khmer, Chinese, and Muslims.
								Tourists are fascinated by the traditional Phnong houses in which there are various
								types of traditional gongs and big jars which are more than a thousand years old. These
								Jars and gongs are among the most valuable possessions of indigenous communities both in
								traditional and spiritual as well as material terms.


								Get further off the beaten tracks and explore the northeastern frontier jungle of
								Mondulkiri safely on the back of an elephant.
								An elephant ride through lush unspoilt tropical rain forest where various large mammals,
								including dholes, bats, bears, wild cattle, buffaloes, deers, elephants, gaurs, gibbons,
								goats, horses, leopards, monkeys, otters, rabbits, tigers and wolves roam, offers one a
								memorable experience promised to last a lifetime.

								greener mode of transportation.</p>

							<h4> COLOMBO</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/srilanka/colombo.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>
								The name 'Colombo', first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be
								derived from the classical Sinhala name කොලොන් තොට Kolon thota, meaning "port on the
								river Kelani".[11]

								Another belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhala name කොල-අඹ-තොට
								Kola-amba-thota which means 'Harbour with leafy/green mango trees'.[10] This coincides
								with Robert Knox's history of the island while he was a prisoner in Kandy. He writes
								that "On the West, the City of Columbo, so-called from a Tree the Natives call Ambo,
								(which bears the Mango-fruit) growing in that place; but this never bare fruit, but only
								leaves, which in their Language is Cola and thence they called the Tree Colambo: which
								the Christians in honour of Columbus turned to Columbo."

								The author of the oldest Sinhala grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century
								wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. It lists
								naramba (to see) and kolamba (ford or harbour) as deriving from the indigenous Vedda
								language. Kolamba may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.
