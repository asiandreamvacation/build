						<h3 id="dubai">DUBAI</h3>
						<figure>
							<img src="/dubai.jpg" alt="">
						</figure>




						<p>Dubai is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is
							located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of
							Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the
							only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the
							country's Federal Supreme Council. The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's
							northern coastline and heads the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai will host
							World Expo 2020. Dubai emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It
							is also a major transport hub forpassengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was
							based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but
							oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969. Dubai's
							oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are
							limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue
							comes from oil.

						<h4> BURJ KHALIFA</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/dubai/burj-khalifa.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>

						<p>
							The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and a global icon. Truly a feat of
							engineering, the building represents the conceptual heart and soul of the city of Dubai.
							At 828m tall, this magnificent structure is located next to The Dubai Mall and has drawn
							visitors from all over the world since opening in 2010. The unmatched Burj Khalifa view can
							be taken in from not one but two observations decks – the two-storey At the Top on the 124th
							and 125th floors, as well as the world’s highest observation deck (555m) on the 148th floor.
						</p>

						


						<h4> AIN DUBAI</h4>

							<img src="/dubai/ain.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>

						<p>
							Ain Dubai is the latest landmark to join Dubai’s long list of world record-breaking attractions, set to open to the public on 21 October. Located on Bluewaters Island, the giant observation wheel stands at a staggering height of 250m making it the highest and largest of its kind in the world.

The monument is an amazing feat of construction, with each leg of the wheel standing 126m high – long enough to fit 15 London buses – while the weight of the assembled hub and spindle is equivalent to four A380 aircrafts.
Accessible from the island, Ain Dubai (which means Dubai Eye in Arabic) is surrounded by unforgettable social and celebratory experiences, making it a must-visit attraction for all.

						<h4> DUBAI AQUARIUM AND UNDERWATER ZOO</h4>

Rising to the third floor of The Dubai Mall, the aquarium is home to 140 species of sea life and offers many incredible ways to experience the underwater world. Stroll through a 48-metre tunnel, with the aquarium enveloping you from overhead and around. It’s a complete fish-eye view, with sand tiger sharks and stingrays swimming overhead.
