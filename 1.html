							<h3 id="singapore">1) SINGAPORE</h3>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore.jpg" alt="">
							</figure>

							<p>Singapore is a city-state in Southeast Asia. Founded as a British trading colony in 1819,
								since independence it has become one of the world's most prosperous countries and boasts
								the world's busiest port. Combining the skyscrapers and subways of a modern, affluent
								city with a medley of Chinese, Malay and Indian influences and a tropical climate, with
								tasty food, good shopping and a vibrant night-life scene, this Garden City makes a great
								stopover or springboard into the region. Some of the main attractions for tourists in
								Singapore are city centre with magnificent lighted buildings, temples, gambling in two
								great casinos, food, entertainment parks and annual festivals. Singapore is also a
								medical tourism centre of Southeastern Asia.
								Singapore is in fact one of the most enjoyable cities in Southeast Asia. As you zoom in
								from one of the world's best airports along the lushly tree-shaded expressway. And as
								you stroll through the fashion emporiums of Orchard Rd, poke around antique shops in
								Chinatown or take a walk around one of the dozens of beautiful city parks, you'll know
								the city bears no comparison to crime- and poverty of neighboring countries. You can be
								drinking and dancing until dawn in the city's pubs and clubs, or sipping a cocktail
								surrounded by the colonial elegance of a Raffles Hotel veranda.
								There's no law that says an Asian city can't be well run. It may have been a long and
								difficult haul from swampy colonial outpost and notorious den of vice to powerhouse
								industrial nation, but those who say that Singapore has lost its soul along the way
								couldn't be more wrong.

								Few cities in Southeast Asia can boast Singapore's fascinating ethnic brew. Where else
								in the world can you dip into the cultures of China, India and Muslim Malaysia all in
								one day, against a backdrop of ultra-modern Western commerce? Not only has Singapore's
								history of migration left a rich cultural and architectural legacy that makes wandering
								the streets an absorbing delight, it has created one of the world's great eating
								capitals. If there's one thing more stylish than the bars and restaurants, it's the
								boutiques that have made Singapore a byword in Asia for extravagant shopping. Away from
								the Gucci and Louis Vuitton onslaught of Orchard Rd, however, there are bargains to be
								found on everything from clothes to electronics - and a range of art and antique shops
								that few Asian cities can match.

								But Singapore is not all about shopping and eating. Nor is the notion of Singapore as
								completely urbanized anything more than popular myth. Adventure activities include
								diving with sharks at Underwater World on Sentosa, mountain biking around Bukit Timah,
								leopard-spotting at Singapore Zoo's magical Night Safari, waterskiing or wakeboarding on
								the Kallang River, go-karting and rock climbing. And if you want to retreat from
								civilization completely, the centre of the island retains large tracts of forest where
								the only sound you can hear is the monkeys swinging through the trees. In fact,
								Singapore is one of only two cities in the world that still retains a patch of primary
								rainforest, in the form of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

								It's a fascinating place - and a remarkable achievement. No-one is denying that
								Singaporeans have had to sacrifice some level of freedom in their island's rise from
								racially divided, resource-starved port town. But you get the feeling that if Western
								development aid had ever matched Singapore's strides in poverty reduction, education,
								infrastructure and health care, they'd be patting themselves on the back and saying that
								political freedom was a small sacrifice to make.
								Besides, it's not all strait-laced conformity. You don't have to look far to find echoes
								of the island's colourful, rakish past, or evidence of a thriving and creatively
								unfettered artistic community. Singapore's soul is alive and well - and it is unique.

							<h4>JURONG BIRD PARK</h4>

							</figure>
							<p>

								This ageing attraction is still popular with school kids, families and nature
								photographers. The Jurong Bird Park is home to 8000 birds -600 species, 30 of them
								endangered. Visitors walk through themed enclosures along 1.7km worth of trails:
								pelicans gawp at passers-by along a boardwalk, leggy pink flamingos stand proud by a
								lake, penguins nosedive through
								water in air-conditioned comfort and cutting through it all is the escapable scent of
								bird poop.


							</p>


							<h4>ORCHARD ROAD</h4>

							<p>

								Famous by name, Orchard Rd was once was lined with nutmeg and pepper plantations.
								Today it's the domain of Singapore's elite and well-heeled tourists, lured here by
								the shopping centres, nightspots, restaurants, bars and lounges. A showcase for the
								material delights of capitalism, Orchard Rd also possesses
								some sights of cultural interest where a credit card is not required.


							</p>


							<h4>LITTLE INDIA</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src="/singapore/little-india.jpeg" alt="">
							</figure>
							<p>

								This modest but colourful area of wall-to-wall shops, pungent aromas and Hindi film
								music
								is a relief from the prim modernity of many parts of the city. Centred around the
								southern
								end of Serangoon Rd, this is the place to come to pick up that framed print of Krishna
								you've always wanted, eat great food and watch streetside cooks fry chapatis. The
								Zhujiao Centre is the main market, but there are also interesting spice shops nearby.
								The best temples are Sri Veeramakaliamman, Sri Srinivasa Perumal and the glitzy Temple
								of 1000 Lights.
