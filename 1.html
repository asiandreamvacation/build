						<h3 id="singapore">SINGAPORE</h3>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore.jpg" alt="">

						<p>A long, long time ago…
							The old Keppel Harbour in Singapore
							A long time ago, Singapore was once known as Sea Town.
							While the earliest known historical records of Singapore are shrouded in time, a third
							century Chinese account describes it as "Pu-luo-chung", referring to "Pulau Ujong" which
							means the "island at the end of a peninsula" in the Malay language. Later, the city was
							known as Temasek ("Sea Town"), when the first settlements were established from AD
							1298-1299.

							During the 14th century, this small but strategically-located island earned a new name.
							According to legend, Sang Nila Utama, a Prince from Palembang (the capital of Srivijaya),
							was out on a hunting trip when he caught sight of an animal he had never seen before. Taking
							it to be a good sign, he founded a city where the animal had been spotted, naming it “The
							Lion City” or Singapura, from the Sanskrit words “simha” (lion) and “pura” (city).
						</p>


						<h4>SINGAPORE FLYER</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/singapore-flyer.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							The Singapore Flyer is an expensive 30-minute ride with views towards the Colonial District,
							CBD, Marina Bay, the high-rise housing landscape to the east and out to the South China Sea.
							You're better off going on a clear day than at night, if only to avoid the annoying flashing
							neon lights outside the cabin


						</p>






						<h4>JURONG BIRD PARK</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/jurong-bird-park.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							This ageing attraction is still popular with school kids, families and nature photographers.
							The Jurong Bird Park is home to 8000 birds -600 species, 30 of them endangered. Visitors
							walk through themed enclosures along 1.7km worth of trails: pelicans gawp at passers-by
							along a boardwalk, leggy pink flamingos stand proud by a lake, penguins nosedive through
							water in air-conditioned comfort and cutting through it all is the escapable scent of bird
							poop.


						</p>


						<h4>ORCHARD ROAD</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/orchard-road.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							Famous by name, Orchard Rd was once was lined with nutmeg and pepper plantations. Today it's
							the domain of Singapore's elite and well-heeled tourists, lured here by the shopping
							centres, nightspots, restaurants, bars and lounges. A showcase for the material delights of
							capitalism, Orchard Rd also possesses some sights of cultural interest where a credit card
							is not required.


						</p>


						



						

						<h4>SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/singapore-botanical-garden.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							If Singapore's urban planners could manufacture paradise, it wouldn't look too different
							from the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The front entrance leads to an idyllic koi pond. On
							weekends, laughing children feed the multicoloured fish. Right behind, a waterfall gurgles
							and birds hop around the water's edge, at ease with the locals.

						</p>

						<h4>NIGHT SAFARI</h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/night-safari.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							You can walk around the three trails in the 40-hectare forested park but the best experience
							is via the tram (adult/child S$10/5), even though we think it's a little cheeky (and greedy)
							that you have to pay for the atmospheric 45-minute jungle tour past a parade of 120
							different spot-lit nocturnal species.


						</p>

						<h4>WINGS OF TIME </h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/wings-of-time.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>

							End your day at Sentosa with the Award Winning Outdoor Night Show (Wings of Time) in the
							world set against the majestic open sea. Be mesmerized by a multi-sensory presentation
							of water display, laser show, fire effects and
							spectacular music as you soar through space and time in a magical adventure.


						</p>

						<h4> UNIVERSAL STUDIOS </h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/universal-studios.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>
							Universal Studios Singapore is a theme park located within Resorts World Sentosa on Sentosa
							Island, Singapore. It was a key component of Genting's bid for the right to build
							Singapore's second integrated resort. It is the second Universal Studios theme park to open
							in Asia (Japan being the first), and the first in Southeast Asia. Universal Parks & Resorts
							markets the park as a "one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia" and promises that the park will
							be the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia for the next 30 years1


						</p>








						<h4> GARDENS BY THE BAY </h4>
						<figure>
							<img src="/singapore/gardens.jpeg" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p>
							Once you've glimpsed this beautifully designed green space (from the top of the Marina Bay
						Sands, perhaps) you won't be able to stay away. Wander through the Bay East Garden, perfect for
						enjoying the vibrant plant life and escaping the city bustle for a moment.Then, head to the
						Cloud Forest Dome to see the world's tallest indoor waterfall and learn a bit about
						biodiversity.
