							<p>Cambodia may be a small country, but it offers everything one needs for a wonderful
								vacation. Above the many reasons why most visitors return to visit time and again, are
								two that many would find difficult to match elsewhere. Firstly, Cambodia offers an
								incredible amount of history and culture and its nature is simply amazing to say the
								least; ranging from the gorgeous National Parks to the pristine beaches and relaxing
								islands, the flavours of Cambodia are not only in the exotic cuisines,
								but also its overall ambience.

								If you’re planning to visit Southeast Asia, Cambodia is certainly a ‘Must-visit’
								destination.</p>





							

							<h4> SIEM REAP</h4>

							<p>
								Siem Reap Province is basically the cradle of Angkorean civilization and it is a
								province that offers plenty of opportunity to tourists enthralled by the Khmer culture.

								The main route to the Angkor Wat The main route to the Angkor Wat
								Srah SrangSrah Srang

								The ruins of Angkor, located amid forests and Farland, are now a UNESCO World Heritage
								Site. There are over one thousand temples ranging in scale from nondescript piles of
								brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the magnificent Angkor Wat which is said
								to be the world’s largest single religious monument. There are dozens of temple ruins in
								the Siem Reap area and it depends largely on how much time one has and one’s level of
								interest to determine how long one should spend to explore them.



								This province is accessible on direct flights from many major cities in the region
								including Bangkok, Danang, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, Paksé, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur,
								Singapore, Hong Kong, Kunming, Taipei, Manila, etc. From the capital of Phnom Penh, the
								Cambodia National Airline operates direct flights daily to and from Siem Reap.

								Siem Reap Province can also be reached by speedboats along the Tonlé Sap from Phnom Penh
								and Battambang Province.

								The Siem Reap Province is conveniently situated 314 km northwest of Phnom Penh, along
								National Road No 6. It can be reached all year round by National Road No 6 from Phnom
								Penh, Poipèt Border Checkpoint, Banteay Meanchey Province, Kampong Cham Province, and
								Kampong Thom Province; and by National Road No 5 and 6 from Kampong Chhnang Province,
								Pursat Province, and Battambang Province.



								This is a vibrant city with many modern hotels and old colonial buildings boasting
								awesome architecture. Much of the town’s image, culture, and traditions are conserved
								despite the influx of tourists from all over the world.


								There are restaurants of almost every culture and also bars and café of nearly every
								fashion and size all about town. The Psar Leu area is where one can find great bargains
								in jewelry and handicraft from precious stones to wonderful woodcarvings. There are also
								many shops offering traditional massage and reflexology to help relieve those tired feet
								after a day’s tour of the temples. </p>

								Landmine Museum
								It is situated on the way to Banteay Srei Temple, Siem Reap. It was founded by a veteran
								using most of his saving. He used to do the landmine removal work, so he has collected
								around 5000 removal landmines and wartime weapons displayed in the museum. There are
								also pictures and stories of victims and introduction about landmine removal work in the
								museum. Every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, from 9:00 to 15:00, there are
								English, Japanese tour guides to let everyone understand more about the history of that
								period.</p>
